    <!-- An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ) . 
        Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters 
        (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). -->
        
    <p>This is blank space &nbsp; in HTML</p> <!-- &nbsp; is non breaking space and is used to give space as by default HTML removes extra space -->
    <p>Paragraph is written like this &lt;p&gt;</p> <!-- To print "<" we use &lt; and to print ">" we use &gt; -->
    <p>Copyright is written like this &copy;</p> <!-- To print copyright symbol we use &copy; -->
    <p>Pound is written like this &pound;</p> <!-- To print pound symbol we use &pound; -->
    <p>Empty Character is written like this &#8203;</p> <!-- To print empty character we use &#8203; -->
