    <!-- Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. 
        Elements such as <header> , <footer> and <article> are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the 
        purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them. 
    -->
    <!-- It is a good practice to define semantic tags as it makes easier for us to view and edit the part we want to. -->
    <details> <!-- We can expand and collapse the details from summary. -->
        <summary>Details are as follows</summary> <!-- Summary is used as a short text which makes it easy for user to access what details he want to see. -->
        Lorem <!-- When we expand the summary these details are shown. In this case on expanding we see a text "Lorem". -->
    </details>
    <p>Hello World! I am <mark>Mayank Saxena</mark></p> <!-- <mark> Tag will mark the text within the tags. -->
    <!-- Refer to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics for learning more HTML Semantic Tags -->
