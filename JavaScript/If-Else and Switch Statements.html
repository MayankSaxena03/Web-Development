    // == : Equals to
    // != : Not equals to
    // === : data type and value equals to
    // !== : data type and value NOT equals to
    // > : Greater than
    // >= : Greater than or equal to
    // < : Less than
    // <= : Less than or equal to
    // && : condition1 && condition2 - All conditions must be true to run the code (AND)
    // || : condition1 || condition2 - Minimum one condition must be true to run the code (OR)

    //Conditional Operator
    //Syntax: (condition?true-statement:false-statement). Example below
    console.log(age==20 ? 'Age is 20' : 'Age is not 20');
